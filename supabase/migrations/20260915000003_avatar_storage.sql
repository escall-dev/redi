-- Migration: Add avatar_url to profiles and configure avatars storage bucket
-- ==============================================================================

-- 1. Add avatar_url column to profiles table if it does not already exist
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public'
      AND table_name = 'profiles'
      AND column_name = 'avatar_url'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Configure Supabase Storage 'avatars' bucket
-- Max size: 10MB (10485760 bytes), Allowed MIME: image/jpeg, image/jpg
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  10485760,
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = true,
  file_size_limit = 10485760,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'];

-- 3. Storage RLS Policies
-- Allow public access to view avatar images
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public avatar read access" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Public avatar read access"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar into avatars/{user_id}/*
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own avatar
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own avatar
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );
